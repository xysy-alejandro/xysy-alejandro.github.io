        Let's look at my favorite things!

    <h2>
        Music ୨୧
    </h2>
    <p>I love music; My dad exposed me to different genres as a kid,
        so I sometimes randomly know songs from even the 70's (I love the Carpenters).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <div class="item-title">Taylor Swift</div>
        </li>
        <p>As they say, Taylor swift <i>is</i> the music industry. I think I started listening to her at the same time
            I started to walk.</p>

        <h5>I read this book in January of 2023. It was so balanced with being both plot <i>and</i> character
            driven. Rated 5/5.</h5>

            <br>I would say, Friends to shows is Taylor Swift to music for me.
            <br> Honorable mentions to my other favorite sitcoms: 'The Big Bang Theory' and 'Modern Family'.

        <h5>
            Gilmore Girls is such an emotional rollercoaster. It made me cry, laugh, and even
            <br> romanticize studying..? I find myself channelling Rory whenever I see my to-do list.
